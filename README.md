# Odin Project Exercises

## About

This repository is just a collection of exercises that I have done in order to complete [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).<br>
The Odin Project is an open-source full-stack curriculum that covers web development from basics to advanced topics.<br>
My goal is to complete all the exercises and projects to solidify my understanding and skills in web development.<br>
The individual projects of The Odin Project that I have completed can be found as separate repos on my profile.
